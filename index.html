<h2>Film Forum Community Standards</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Our film criticism forum operates on three core principles: cite your sources when referencing production details or critical interpretations, clearly label spoilers to respect those who haven't seen a film, and be specific in your observations by referencing particular scenes, shots, or performances rather than vague generalities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The film forum community thrives when members engage in respectful debate grounded in evidence and close observation. We use simple spoiler tags in thread titles and post headers—no complex technology required—to ensure everyone can participate without fear of unwanted revelations. Disagreement is welcome and encouraged, but arguments should focus on the films themselves rather than personal attacks. Our Canadian context means we're particularly attentive to discussions of Canadian cinema, regional distribution patterns, and the unique challenges and opportunities facing film culture in Canada. This movie discussion board succeeds when diverse voices contribute thoughtfully to our shared appreciation of cinema.</p>
